This repository contains 3 machine learning/pattern recognition projects each applying a different technique and application.
1. Face Recognition using PCA/LDA algorithms
2. Network Anomalies Detection using K-Means/K-Way Normalized Cut clustering algorithims.
3. Speech Emotion Recognition using CNNs.

## Side Note
If you stumble upon this repository while desparately trying to finish a machine learning project. At least try to understand what you might be copying :).
